# cookiecutter-p5js

A minimal cookiecutter for p5js projects, based on the es6-boilerplate cookiecutter by @agconti.

## Overview
This project takes care of the setup and configuration so you can focus on making your app awesome.  The minimal branch takes out a lot of the automation and build tools found on the master branch.  This simply provides the p5 links, and basic html and javascript files to get you started.  Definitely a good place to start for someone unfamiliar with the JavaScript ecosystem of build tools.
